# Westeros's Smallest Political Quiz

This is inspired by the *[World's Smallest Political Quiz](https://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php)*.

There are probably quite a few ways to think about politics in Westeros, but the one explored here is a two-axis system taking into account views on social liberty and crown authority. This gives us four main camps: tyrants, populists, regressivists, and visionaries.

**Tyrants** suppress social liberty and desire large amounts of power for themselves.

**Populists** promote social liberty and are more comfortable with the idea of a republic.

**Regressivists** seek to yank society back into a time when it was every man for himself.

**Visionaries** have a strong, unique, positive vision for the future and try to single-handedly reshape the world - through force, if necessary - into a better place.

I've come up with ten questions that relate (to varying degrees) to issues of social liberty and crown authority, and provided the answers to those questions from the perspective of several major ASOIAF characters as a way to test them out. You can hover over any name in the graph for their answers and the rationale for them.

Lastly, you can answer the questions yourself to see how your own views stack up in the world of Westerosi politics.
